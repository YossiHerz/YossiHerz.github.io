        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Itâ€™s probably been over 10 years since I typed the words, "Hello world" for the first time. Since then I have taught myself graphic design, how to play guitar, and all the ins and outs of web development. Today I provide cutting edge, fully responsive website for many clients. Using the elements of design and the importance of the harmony of different elements, which I have learned as a graphic designer and guitar player. Therefore, I am able to deliver beautiful websites, with fine-tuned code as well as beautiful design providing a smooth experience to the client. </p>
